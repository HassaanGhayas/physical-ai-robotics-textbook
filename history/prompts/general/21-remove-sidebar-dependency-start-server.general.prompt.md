## Prompt

Do npm start and remove extra libraries dependencies used in the sidebar other than docusaurus default sidebar settings

## Response Snapshot

Successfully started the development server (`npm start`) and identified/removed extra library dependencies from the sidebar configuration. The build was failing due to a missing CSS import (`mobile-sidebar-enhanced.css`) that was not needed.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Started npm development server**
   - Command: `npm start`
   - Server running at: http://localhost:3000/physical-ai-robotics-textbook/
   - Initial state: Build failing with CSS import error

2. **Analyzed sidebar configuration**
   - Verified `sidebars.ts` already uses only Docusaurus default settings (autogenerated sidebars)
   - Identified the issue in `src/css/custom.css` line 20

3. **Removed extra dependency**
   - File: `D:\my-web\src\css\custom.css`
   - Removed: `@import './mobile-sidebar-enhanced.css';`
   - This import was causing build errors because the file doesn't exist
   - The sidebar now uses only Docusaurus default settings

### Build Results

**Before Fix:**
```
Error: Can't resolve './mobile-sidebar-enhanced.css' in 'D:\my-web\src\css'
client (webpack 5.103.0) compiled with 2 errors
```

**After Fix:**
```
✔ Client: Compiled successfully in 2.43s
client (webpack 5.103.0) compiled successfully
```

### Verification

- ✅ Development server running successfully
- ✅ No build errors
- ✅ Webpack compilation successful
- ✅ Sidebar uses only Docusaurus default configuration
- ✅ No extra library dependencies

### Technical Details

**Sidebar Configuration:**
- Location: `sidebars.ts`
- Type: Autogenerated (Docusaurus default)
- Configuration: `{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'book'}`

**Dependencies Removed:**
- `mobile-sidebar-enhanced.css` import (non-existent file)

The sidebar styling in `custom.css` (lines 1540-1620) is pure CSS and doesn't require any external libraries, so it's kept as is.

## Outcome

- Development server running without errors
- Sidebar configuration clean and using only Docusaurus defaults
- Build compiles successfully in ~2.4 seconds
- Ready for development and implementation of UI/UX design system tasks
