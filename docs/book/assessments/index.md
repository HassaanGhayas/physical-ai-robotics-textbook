# Assessments

Focus: Evaluation methods and practical projects.

## Overview

This module covers the assessment methods and practical projects used to evaluate understanding of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. Each assessment builds upon the concepts learned in previous modules.

## Assessment Structure

This module covers:

1. **ROS 2 package development project**: Developing a complete ROS 2 package for humanoid robot control
2. **Gazebo simulation implementation**: Creating and implementing a simulation environment
3. **Isaac-based perception pipeline**: Building a perception system using NVIDIA Isaac
4. **Capstone: Simulated humanoid robot with conversational AI**: A comprehensive project integrating all learned concepts

## Assessment Types

### Project-Based Assessments
- Hands-on development of ROS 2 packages
- Simulation environment creation and testing
- Perception pipeline implementation
- Full system integration projects

### Practical Evaluations
- Real-time robot control challenges
- Simulation-to-reality transfer validation
- Multi-modal interaction systems
- Autonomous behavior demonstrations

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Develop complete ROS 2 packages for humanoid robotics applications
- Create and validate simulation environments
- Build perception systems using advanced tools
- Integrate multiple subsystems for complex robotic behaviors
- Demonstrate comprehensive understanding through capstone projects

## Assessment Criteria

Each assessment will be evaluated based on:

- Technical correctness and implementation quality
- Innovation and problem-solving approach
- Integration of multiple concepts
- Documentation and reproducibility
- Performance and efficiency considerations

## Prerequisites
